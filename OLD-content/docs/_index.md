## OA Merge

Merge and share OpenAPI endpoints and schemas.

Install it the normal way [from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oamerge):

```bash
npm install oamerge
```

Point it at a folder to build:

```bash
oamerge --input ./folder --output ./build
```

In development mode, use `--watch` (or `-w`) to rebuild when changes are detected.
